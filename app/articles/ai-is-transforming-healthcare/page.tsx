              Healthcare has always balanced two priorities: providing the best
              possible patient care and managing the complex systems that
              deliver it. Today, artificial intelligence is helping clinicians
              and administrators bridge that gap. AI is already assisting
              doctors, nurses, and veterinarians in real-world settings, cutting
              costs, improving accuracy, and allowing providers to focus more on
              patients.

            From Buzzword to Bedside
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Not long ago, AI in medicine sounded like science fiction. Now it is
            quietly woven into daily workflows. Hospitals are using AI to
            analyze imaging scans in seconds, alert teams to patients at risk of
            sepsis, and even transcribe clinical notes during appointments.
            Reports show that AI tools are achieving accuracy comparable to
            medical experts in diagnostics, while also reducing burnout by
            taking over routine administrative work.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
            The technology is not replacing doctors, but supporting them. AI
            augments human intelligence, freeing clinicians from clerical
            burdens so they can spend more time in direct patient care.

                At Valley Medical Center, nurses implemented an AI platform to
                help with utilization management. Case review rates jumped from
                60% to 100%, and the observation admit rate rose from 4% to 13%,
                aligning with Medicare benchmarks. Extended observation stays
                dropped by 25%, saving money and staff time. Nurses reported
